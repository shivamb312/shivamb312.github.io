        English 182 has been like a journey for me. A journey where I learned more about composition than I could ever imagine. When I started this class, I really had confidence issues. I felt like my English much inferior to most of the students. I hardly hard any experience in English composition. But throughout the class, as I worked on my assignments, my confidence increased.  I frequently went above the deadlines, and tried to catch up, falling behind. I have tried hard, though internally I know that I have failed miserably. Anyway, I think I have learned a lot from the course, in a way which would benefit me in the future.     </p>
    <p>
        In the beginning of the course, we were introduced with Multimodal composition and its different aspects like genres and modes. I had trouble with understanding what Multimodality meant. I used some multimodality for the first time in my Short Assignment 2. For this assignment we were supposed to visit a museum and observe an artifact and its presentation. I chose to visit “Burke Museum of Natural History and Culture” where I observed a section showcasing traditional canoes and paddles used in the past by Native Americans. I believe that this visit to the museum really helped me to understand multimodality as I observed the different information in that section of the museum. The museum used various multimodal modes to convey information to public which was very interesting to learn from. Learning from this visit, I used images in my assignment to explain my experience at the museum in the assignment. 
    </p>
    <p>
        My second experience with Multimodal composition came with Major Project 1, as I made an infographic showing my thought process and ideas. The hardest task about this assignment was developing a good claim. I did not have much experience with reading complex papers and developing claims out of them. Synthesizing a claim out of two such papers was an extremely different task for me. But the process really taught me a few things about research and analysis. It also helped me develop my thought process while working on an idea. The library research workshop at Odegaard helped me especially. The second and final part of the project was to prepare an infographic to explain my idea. I put a lot of effort into preparing this and tried to experiment with colors and graphics. It was a very fun process. 
    </p>
    <p>
        I also learned a lot more about multimodal composition after our workshop at Suzallo library where we were introduced to various very-well-crafted multimodal projects. Some of the projects really shook me with their brilliance and creativity. They really shaped a basis in my mind, and developed a stronger definition of multimodality in my brain. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Further in the class, working on the Major Project 2 was a delight. It was the most meaningful part of the class as it let me work on the topic of "Online Privacy" which I am very much passionate about. As we had freedom to take any direction with this project, I planned to write about the misuse of our data by big tech. In my opinion, this is a very major issue with very little attention. As I was researching more into the issue, I started to think of alternative solutions/models. That’s what got me thinking a lot and took most of my time, as I developed my model. Short Assignment 3 consisted of a proposal for MP2, where I outlined my ideas for the project. Next stage of the MP2 development was the Peer review workshop which I benefitted a lot from. When I appeared for this workshop, my paper’s idea and content were in a very undeveloped stage. And honestly, I did not expect to obtain such a constructive feedback from my peers, something that helped me enormously with MP2. All the reviews provided me with cool ideas and structural suggestions which I tried to implement. The workshops were a great way to conduct peer reviews, and I think helped all students in the course. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The week after the workshop, when I was writing the final draft for MP2 was the most fun for me. As that’s when I wrote the most crucial parts of my paper. I used feedbacks of my peers and friends to make strong structural changes and elaborate at a bunch of instances. Moreover, doing all the research and figuring out how I could better explain each and every section was an exercise I really enjoyed. I worked really hard on the Major project 2. I hope I didn’t do too bad of a job. I think that a lot of flaws were still left in the final draft of MP2. I have tried to cover those in my revision plan submitted with this portfolio. 
    </p>
    <p>
        For the final portfolio, I also revised Short Assignment 1 and Short Assignment 3. For both these assignments,  I focused on the grading rubric and tried to find my faults. In SA1 revision, I focused a lot more on the target audience. I tried my best engaging them with my writing. Also, I thought of things that really connect the community around my chosen artifact (Apple) and talked more about how they bound the community. I think I made a really good revision to SA1. For SA3, I worked on adding critical questions and replies to them. I also talked more about genres and modes. 
    </p>
    <p>
        If I was asked, what I regret the most during the course besides missing deadlines, I would say that I regretted not composing a podcast or a video for an assignment.  As doing that would have put me in an uncomfortable spot and taught me something new. I plan to try that out when the next opportunity strikes. English 182 has taught me skills around composition which I will cherish for the rest of my life. As I will use them at various opportunities in my life.
